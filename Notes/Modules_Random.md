# 📦 Python Modules – Summary

---

## ✅ What is a module?
A **module** is a file that contains Python code – such as **functions**, **variables**, and **classes** – that you can **reuse** in other programs.

Think of it as a **toolbox 🧰** you can import when needed.

---

## 🧠 Why use modules?

- ✅ To **keep your code organized**
- 🔁 To **reuse code** (Don’t Repeat Yourself – DRY principle)
- 🧩 To **use built-in or external features**, such as:
  - `math` – for mathematical operations
  - `random` – for generating random values
  - `datetime` – for handling dates and times
  - `os`, `sys`, `collections`, and many more...
